# About myself
I'm a technical specialist in online schools. I create websites in the constructor and write email newsletters. I think, we need to develop skills and learn to move forward. So I decided to develop and study Frontend Development. That's why I'm here in RS School. I'm sure the desire to learn will help me become a competitive specialist in Frontend Development.
